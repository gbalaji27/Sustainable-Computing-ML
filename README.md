# Sustainable-Computing-ML
This project develops a machine learning model to analyze and optimize power consumption &amp; carbon emissions in chip design workflows. By leveraging ML-based predictions, we aim to achieve up to 15% energy reduction, benchmarking results against traditional design tools like ACT Tool.
